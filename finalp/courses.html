    <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&coid=57598" target="_blank">DEV109</a> - Intro to Web Development</h2>
    <h3>Taught by Professor Adam Brehm</h3>
    <p>
      Before this class, my coding experience did not contain any knowledge regarding HTML, CSS or Javascript, so simply learning how to make and host a basic webpage was a new activity to me. Following the completion of this class, I'm able to create and host a webpage using HTML syntax, customize its appearance with CSS, and add ways for the user to interact with the page using Javascript.

    <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=14&coid=56195&print" target="_blank">CHEM&110</a> - Chemical Concepts w/ Lab</h2>
    <h3>Taught by Dr. Perminder Sandhu</h3>
    <p>
      This class revolved around the chemistry of cooking. Prior to this class, while I do cook regularly I've never looked deeply into the chemistry of my dishes and why they turn out the way they do outside of practice. Following the completion of this class, I'm able to identify fundamental chemistry concepts related to the dishes I make, such as how acids and bases are affected by temperature, how gelatinization affects starches, and how osmosis relates to brining and food preservation.
