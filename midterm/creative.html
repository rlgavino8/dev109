    <h2 style="color:White;">Fun Fact about me:</h2>
    <p style="color:White;">
      Coach Ryan Gavino is a computer science student at Gonzaga University and a coach at Gonzaga Preparatory School.

Gavino competed at the #1 varsity position for Southridge High School from 2016-2020, playing singles at the no. 1 position for 4 years and named team captain junior and senior year. During his time on the team, he provided independent private lessons to the junior tennis community in the Tri-Cities area, from beginner children to varsity/tournament high schoolers. 

While studying at Gonzaga University, Gavino played #2 singles and #1 doubles for the Gonzaga club tennis team, serving as the team’s captain both his junior and senior year. Gavino helped the club team reach a top-4 finish every year of the Tennis On Campus Sectional Championship for the PNW section, qualifying for the National Championship his freshman year.

In addition to his commitment as a player for the club team, he serves as a hitting partner for both the men’s and women’s tennis teams at Whitworth University. Gavino continues to offer private lessons to a widening playerbase of both adults and juniors in the Spokane area for the school year, and the Tri-Cities area over breaks.

Gavino’s passion for teaching extends outside of the tennis court. He served as a TA in the computer science department, where he provided additional lessons/homework help for all lower-division CS courses offered.
