  <h3>
    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
  </h3>
  <li>
    Prior to taking this course, I did not have any knowledge about HTML, CSS, or Javascript outside of knowing these languages were used in the field of web development. I've coded in Python, C++ and Java, but never any HTML/CSS/Javascript.

  <h3>
    Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
  </h3>
  <li>
    I opted to build my portfolio mostly from scratch; I used the navigation menu from Module 04 as a base to build off of. From this starting point, I added each of the required pages described in the project description to the navigation menu, then filled out each page with their respective conditions.

  <h3>
    What was your most challenging part of your portfolio?
  </h3>
  <li>
    The most challenging part of the portfolio was definitely validating the inputs given in the Contact Me page. The primary obstacle was finding expressions for both the name fields and the email field. Checking if the input was letters only required a regular expression, and checking the email address took checking the index of the special characters @ and . to ensure they were correctly formatted. Aside from this, creating the script in JS put together a few different concepts used in previous assignments, such as gathering user input like in Module 05 and interacting with the DOM to make visual changes to the webpage like in Modules 08 and 09.

    How did this class change your view on Web Development?
  </h3>
  <li>
    I believe this course opened my eyes into how many different pieces work together to make a good looking, functional webpage. Learning about how much freedom there is even with just a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript foundation combines problem-solving and creativity in a fun, user-centric way.
  </li>
  
  <h3>
    What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
  </h3>
  <li>
    A large unspoken part of what makes programming assignments difficult is debugging the code after the initial tests. It can be a lot of head-scratching and Google searching to find a similar/identical use case. Some key things to remember is to block out more time than you think to troubleshoot these bugs and learn how to use Google search more descriptively to aid in finding solutions rather than simply copying and pasting the error code.
